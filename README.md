# FILTER corpus

This repository stores the publicly available part of the dataset used in the
[FILTER](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/filter-project/] project as a set of
plain-text files (CSV, GeoJSON).

It is the result of running the
[filter-pipeline](https://github.com/hsci-r/filter-pipeline) on the
collections [SKVR](https://github.com/sks190/SKVR)
and [ERAB](https://github.com/rahvaluule/erab), and is stored here
for convenience. The dataset can be further converted to an SQL database
using the recipes in [filter-db](https://github.com/hsci-r/filter-db).

The data is stored using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) (Large File Storage).
